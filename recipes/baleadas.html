    <h1>Baleadas</h1>
        <img src="../images/baleadaimage.jpeg" alt="A baleada dish">
        <p>A baleada is a traditional Honduran dish, believed to have originated on the northern coast of Honduras. It is composed of a flour tortilla, filled with a smear of mashed "refried" red beans, crema (mantequilla blanca), and crumbled queso duro (salty hard cheese). This is usually called baleada sencilla (simple baleada). Another common variety of baleada is the baleada mixta (mixed baleada) which is baleada sencilla with the addition of scrambled eggs. Many other people add sausage, plantain, hot sauce, avocado, chicken, pork and chismol which is diced tomato, onion and bell pepper. The big Honduran towns often have more than one restaurant that sells baleadas.</p>
