                <li>Place the garlic, ginger, jalapeno, bell pepper, cilantro, tomatoes and onion in a food processer and process until very fine. Depending on the size of your food processor this may take a few different rounds.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil on medium heat in a large Dutch oven and add the processed mixture.  Stir a bit until flavors combine but ingredients are not burnt, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the seafood stock and coconut milk. Stir to combine and then bring to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>Add the sweet potato, green banana, plantains, oregano, and ground annatto.  Stir to combine and let simmer for 8 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the two lobster tails to the pot and cook for another 8 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, add the cod fish and shrimp to the pot and cook for another 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>To serve, remove the two lobster tails and put each in their own deep soup bowl.  Ladle in the soup around the lobster tails and garnish with extra cilantro and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce.
